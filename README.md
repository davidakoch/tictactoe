I used a tutorial to create a tictactoe game with pure javascript. Then I set the challenge of trying to create the game with jQuery; which is script2. 

The html and css includes some experimental code used to successfully add columns borders with Bootstrap. I blocked that code out and then went to create my tictactoe board with a table format. 

I used a bootstrap override id to override bootstrap css to create a black border
